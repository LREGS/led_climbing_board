##User account and log book 

1. User logins 
2. Store and save what a user has sent in a json 
    2.1 create an entry into the json every time someone creates a user account 
3. when a user log ins load the json and find a way to display all of the climbs they have sent,
4. would I want a seperate JSON for projects etc? or then do you just want a linked database for each user with each row representing a user and each column representing climbs sent, projects, flashes etc 


5. some buttons on the homepage thqat will represent each user, and the button 
can be called user1, user2 etc and as a user logs in it rechanges the name to user "William". Then once this button is clicked (have as exclusive checkable button) then if a user ticks a climb it will update the database, the same for if a user creates a climb, or flashes etc etc
    - I think the buttons need to be part of a button group so they can be set as exclusive.



[x] added a custom signal to represent user login
[] add a custom database for each user of their sends etc 
[] change button which will hold user data 
[] change the climb loaded based on user 
[] change climb saved data based on user profile
